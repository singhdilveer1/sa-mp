- A special shoutout to https://sa-mp.mp/ for the time and money they put into providing a safe place for people to download SA-MP. This repository aims to preserve their work and ensure the SA-MP legacy lives on.

- The website is not an exact replica, the Download page, for example, has been modified to add some helpful links. Also, credit goes to [KrustyKoyle](https://github.com/KrustyKoyle) for collecting all the executables in one place.
